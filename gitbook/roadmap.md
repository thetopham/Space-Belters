# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

**Phase 1: Genesis NFT Release**

* Launch the Space Belters Genesis NFT collection, featuring 10,000 unique characters set in a futuristic world.
* Each Space Belter NFT will be an ERC721 token, representing a distinctive character within the Tiamat Universe.&#x20;

**Phase 2: NFT Staking and Space Elevator Contract**

* Develop and deploy the Space Elevator smart contract, allowing users to stake their Space Belter NFTs and earn ERC20 tokens as rewards based on the level of their NFT.&#x20;
* Introduce an ERC20 token as a reward for staking NFTs at the Space Elevator contract.
* As the percentage of tokens in the contract depletes, the space elevator's construction progress increases, with completion achieved when the contract is empty of ERC20 tokens.
* Users can also upgrade their NFT by burning ERC20 tokens through the NFT Upgrade Contract, which allows for further increases in staking rewards for each level gained.

**Phase 3: The Race to Level 60**&#x20;

* Introduce a dapp that tracks the highest level NFTs and displays a leaderboard of "The Race to Level 60".
* The top finishers will receive a reward in ETH and an exclusive NFT drop. This will incentivize collectors to level up their NFTs and create a competitive atmosphere within the community to complete construction of the space elevator.

**Phase 4: Token Level Gated Content**

* Implement token level gated content that requires a certain token level to participate and complete successfully.
* Endgame content will require the maximum level of a level 60 Space Belter NFT with high DPS (staking per hour).

**Phase 5: Future Development and Growth**

* Continue to introduce new features, upgrades, and innovations based on community feedback and market trends.
* Potential developments may include new staking opportunities, utilities for the ERC20 token, and integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
* This stage will ensure that the Space Belters collection remains relevant, engaging, and valuable for collectors.
